## Project Description
My project focuses on Spotify features for each song and if we are able to predict the next Grammy winner for best song of the year with this information.

## Questions & Hypotheses
Are grammy winning songs equal in terms of Spotify features versus regular songs?
Is it possible to predict the next Best song of the year based on Spotify features?

## Dataset
I used a CSV containiing +160.000 songs that I found in Kaggle.
For web scrapping, I used Selenium to get the names of the last Grammy winners for Best song of the year from 1990-2020
Finally, I used Spotify API to get information needed for specific grammy winners that were not in the csv

## Workflow
I first planned my project, which I followed very strictically and then I executed the steps that I had marked in Trello

## Organization
I used Trello to organize myself in order to follow a step by step approach to follow a path in order to finish the project in a structured way.
